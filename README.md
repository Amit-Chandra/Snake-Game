# Snake Game

This is an implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Create a virtual environment for the project. You can do this using `venv` module if you're using Python 3:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install Pygame library within the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
4. Clone this repository to your local machine.
5. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
6. Run the `game.py` file using Python.
7. Control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
8. Eat the red food to grow longer.
9. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary or itself.
